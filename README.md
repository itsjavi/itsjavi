### Creating a Full-Stack Framework
I am not very happy about the current state of the frontend in the last years (2021-2024), so 
I am also interested in creating a full-stack framework that could make Next.js blush,
heavily relying on modern web standards (rather than reinventing or ovewritting them),
supporting SSG, SSR, Pre-rendering and HTML streaming, and also supporting any cloud platform
(CloudFlare, AWS, Vercel, Azure, etc.) so devs don't get vendor-locked/trapped.

I am currently in a research phase, studying the techniques others are using (Next, Astro, Remix, Vike, Lume, Honox),
but I will be happy to join efforts with other devs, specially those with experience in meta framework internals and Rust (or similar).

## Open for Hiring

🚀 Looking for a great dev? [Reach out!](https://itsjavi.com) 

While I am not actively looking for a change at the moment,
I am always open to hear what the world has to offer to me.

Specially interested in EU-based full remote positions, in a creativity-related business (fintech and e-commerce is not my thing anymore).
